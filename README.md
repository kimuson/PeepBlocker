# PeepBlocker
## Overview
It is a peep prevention system for home work and telework.
I created this system for individuals or corporations who need security guarantees for the introduction of telework.

This system prevents the leakage of internal information by displaying a black screen on the PC screen when multiple persons other than yourself look into the PC screen.In addition, it is possible to record the moment of being looked into by an image, and to record the person who looked into.

I hope that this source code can contribute to stop the spread of coronavirus in a little bit.
